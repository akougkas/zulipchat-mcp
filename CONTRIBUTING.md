## Quick Start (Development)

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed (we use uv for everything)

Setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akougkas/zulipchat-mcp.git
cd zulipchat-mcp
uv sync

# Optional: local env (never commit secrets)
cp -n .env.example .env || true

# Run the MCP server locally (example; requires credentials)
uv run zulipchat-mcp --zulip-email your@email.com \
  --zulip-api-key YOUR_KEY \
  --zulip-site https://yourorg.zulipchat.com
```

Helpful docs:

- README: `README.md`
- Development guidelines for agents/tools: `AGENTS.md`
- Claude Code specifics: `CLAUDE.md`
- Testing documentation: `docs/testing/README.md`
- API reference: `docs/api-reference/`
- Troubleshooting guide: `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

Security & configuration:

- Do not commit secrets. Use `.env` (gitignored) or CLI flags.
- Prefer CLI flags in MCP clients. Background features support `--enable-listener`.

## Project Structure (What to Edit Where)

```text
src/zulipchat_mcp/
├── core/           # Client, cache, commands
├── tools/          # MCP tool groups (messaging, streams, search, events, users, files)
├── services/       # Background services (listener, scheduler)
├── integrations/   # Client installers (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
├── utils/          # Logging, metrics, database
└── config.py       # Configuration management
```

Tool group pattern (v2.5):

- New tools live under `src/zulipchat_mcp/tools/`
- Expose a registration function like `register_*_tools(mcp)` that mirrors existing modules
- Follow v2.5 import style (no legacy flat imports):

```python
from src.zulipchat_mcp.core.client import ZulipClientWrapper
```

## Development Standards

Run these before you push:

```bash
uv run pytest -q                       # tests (90% coverage gate in CI)
uv run ruff check .                    # lint
uv run black .                         # format (line length 88)
uv run mypy src                        # type-check
```

Recommended (optional) security checks:

```bash
uv run bandit -q -r src
uv run safety check
```

Style & conventions:

- Python 3.10+, 4-space indentation
- Black (line length 88), Ruff (pycodestyle, pyflakes, isort, bugbear, pyupgrade)
- Names: functions/variables `snake_case`, classes `CamelCase`, constants `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, modules `lower_snake_case.py`
- Public APIs should be type-annotated
- Prefer async for I/O; use guard clauses and clear error handling
- Keep imports sorted; avoid deep nesting

Testing guidelines:

- Put tests under `tests/` as `test_*.py` (classes `Test*`, functions `test_*`)
- Mock Zulip API calls; keep tests deterministic and network-free
- Use markers to scope local runs:

```bash
uv run pytest -q -m "not slow and not integration"
```

- Note: Running only contract tests like `-k "contract_"` can trip the global coverage gate. When exploring locally, use `--no-cov`:

```bash
uv run pytest -q -k "contract_" --no-cov
```

- Before big coverage pushes, a clean slate helps:

```bash
rm -rf .venv .pytest_cache **/__pycache__ htmlcov .coverage* coverage.xml .uv_cache
uv sync --reinstall
```

## Git Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   - Suggested naming: `type/scope-short-description` (e.g., `feat/search-aggregations`)
2. Use Conventional Commits for messages:
   - `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `perf:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `release:`
3. Keep PRs focused and reasonably small. Large refactors should be split and discussed first.
4. Update docs when behavior or commands change (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`).
5. Avoid breakages in public APIs; if unavoidable, call out clearly as breaking change.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before requesting review, please ensure:

- [ ] Title uses Conventional Commits style
- [ ] PR description explains motivation, approach, and alternatives considered
- [ ] Linked issue (if applicable)
- [ ] Tests added/updated; suite passes locally via `uv run pytest -q`
- [ ] Lint, format, and type-check pass (`ruff`, `black`, `mypy`)
- [ ] No secrets, keys, or credentials in code, tests, or commit history
- [ ] Docs updated if behavior, CLI flags, or tool APIs changed (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`)
- [ ] Example CLI invocation/output included when relevant
- [ ] For tools: follows v2.5 registration pattern under `src/zulipchat_mcp/tools/`

Review & merge:

- Maintainers review for clarity, correctness, tests, and alignment with project scope
- We generally use squash-and-merge to keep history clean

## Releases (FYI)

Only maintainers can publish releases. Community PRs are welcome and will be included in the next release as appropriate. We follow Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). See release documentation in `docs/releases/` for version history.

If you propose a change that affects user-visible behavior, please add a short "Proposed change note" in your PR description to help with release notes.

## Documentation Updates

When adding features or changing behavior, consider whether any of the following should be updated:

- `README.md` (features, installation, integration examples)
- `AGENTS.md` (repository guidelines, dev commands)
- `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code usage and command syntax)
- `docs/api-reference/` (API documentation for tools)
- `docs/user-guide/` (user-facing documentation)
- `docs/developer-guide/` (architecture and development docs)
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (common issues and solutions)
