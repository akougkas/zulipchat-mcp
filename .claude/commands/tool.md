description: Scaffold a new MCP tool for Zulip
argument-hint: [tool-name]

Help me create a new MCP tool called "$1" for the Zulip Chat server.

First, research the Zulip API documentation for this functionality, then design the tool architecture, implement it following MCP specifications, and create comprehensive tests.

Use the orchestrator agent to coordinate this multi-step task.
