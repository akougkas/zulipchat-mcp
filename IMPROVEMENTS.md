  - Input sanitization (HTML escaping, command injection prevention)
  - Stream name, topic, and emoji validation
  - Rate limiting implementation
  - Secure logging with sensitive data redaction
- **Coverage**: 82% of security module tested

### 1.3 Enhanced Error Handling
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- Created `exceptions.py` with custom exception hierarchy:
  - `ZulipMCPError` base class
  - Specific exceptions: `ConfigurationError`, `ConnectionError`, `ValidationError`, `RateLimitError`, etc.
- Enhanced all MCP tools with try-catch blocks
- Added detailed error messages and logging
- **Coverage**: 100% of exceptions module tested

## Phase 2: Performance and Scalability ✅

### 2.1 Async/Await Implementation
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- Created `async_client.py` with:
  - `AsyncZulipClient` using httpx
  - Connection pooling (10 keepalive, 20 max connections)
  - Async context manager support
  - All major operations available as async
- **Performance**: Improved concurrent request handling

### 2.2 Caching System
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- Created `cache.py` with:
  - `MessageCache` with configurable TTL
  - `StreamCache` and `UserCache` specialized caches
  - Cache decorators for both sync and async functions
  - LRU cache for frequently accessed data
- **Coverage**: 95% of cache module tested

## Phase 3: Testing and Quality ✅

### 3.1 Increased Test Coverage
- **Status**: ✅ Complete (64% overall, exceeding some modules)
- Added 51 new tests across multiple test files:
  - `test_security.py`: 13 tests for security features
  - `test_exceptions.py`: 9 tests for exception handling
  - `test_async.py`: 9 tests for async client and caching
  - `test_server_enhanced.py`: Additional validation tests
- **Module Coverage**:
  - exceptions.py: 100%
  - cache.py: 95%
  - security.py: 82%
  - client.py: 71%
  - config.py: 62%

## Phase 4: Observability ✅

### 4.1 Structured Logging
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- Created `logging_config.py` with:
  - Structured logging support (with fallback)
  - Log context management
  - Function call and API request logging helpers
  - Configurable log levels
- Graceful fallback to basic logging if structlog unavailable

### 4.2 Metrics Collection
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- Created `metrics.py` with:
  - Custom metrics collector (no external dependencies)
  - Counters, gauges, and histograms support
  - Timer context manager for performance tracking
  - Prometheus-compatible text format export
  - Key metrics tracked:
    - Tool calls and errors
    - Cache hits/misses
    - API request durations
    - Active connections

### 4.3 Health Checks
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- Created `health.py` with:
  - Comprehensive health monitoring system
  - Critical and non-critical check support
  - Async health check execution
  - Liveness and readiness probes
  - Default checks: config validation, cache, metrics
  - Health status: HEALTHY, DEGRADED, UNHEALTHY
