# Changelog

## [2.5.0] - 2025-09-14 ‚Äî Enhanced Packaging & Distribution

### Enhanced Credential Management
- Enhanced `.env` loading to check both current directory and home directory (~/.env)
- Improved error messages for missing credentials with clear guidance on all configuration methods
- Priority order: CLI arguments > current directory .env > home directory .env > environment variables

### Distribution & Installation
- Verified all installation methods work with real Zulip credentials:
  - PyPI installation with pre-built wheels (fastest)
  - GitHub installation building from source (functional, slower)
  - TestPyPI installation for pre-release testing
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated PyPI publishing
- Added MANIFEST.in for proper package distribution
- Reorganized documentation structure (moved release notes to docs/v2.5.0/)

### Claude Code Integration
- Fixed Claude Code MCP integration syntax with proper `--` separator
- Verified real-world functionality with comprehensive testing
- Updated documentation with tested command patterns

### Project Organization
- Updated .gitignore to exclude agent-specific configuration files
- Enhanced development documentation for AI agents (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Ready for public v2.5.0 PyPI release

## [2.5.0] - 2025-09-13 ‚Äî Fixes & Test Polish

### Fixes
- core(client): Implement missing wrapper methods used by v2.5 tools ‚Äî `get_user_by_email`, `get_user_by_id`, `get_message`, `update_message_flags`, and events methods `register`/`deregister`/`get_events`. These restore users_v25, messaging_v25 bulk ops, and events_v25 flows.
- core(client): Normalize parameter handling for `get_subscribers(stream_id=...)` and make `add_subscriptions(...)` accept both `subscriptions=[...]` (tools) and `streams=[...]` (legacy SDK) with optional `principals`/`announce`/`authorization_errors_fatal`.

### Tests
- Added targeted unit tests lifting coverage over 90% without network: security/topic helpers, streams_v25 manager/branch paths, metrics histogram trimming.
- Config: minor coverage omit for heavy internal batch processor consistent with existing omit strategy.

### Docs
- BUGS.md updated to mark these issues resolved with verification notes; AGENTS.md kept guidance-only (no new paradigms introduced).

## [2.5.0] - 2025-09-12 ‚Äî Testing & Docs

### ‚úÖ Test Suite Enhancements (‚â•90% coverage)
- Re-included `search_v25.py` and `streams_v25.py` in coverage scope and raised the coverage gate to `--cov-fail-under=90`.
- Added focused unit/component tests covering:
  - Advanced Search (messages/users/streams/topics): relevance + time ranges, oldest/newest windows, highlights, aggregations, has_more semantics, zero-match paths.
  - Daily Summary: mixed stream results with error-continue, single-active-stream insights, heavy-senders slicing to top 10.
  - Analytics: activity/sentiment/topics/participation across summary/detailed/chart_data formats; group_by user/stream/day/hour; no-messages and exception guards.
  - Streams: manage_streams list permutations; manage_topics delete/move/mark_read error handling; stream_analytics stats with error/exception branches.
- Introduced shared fixtures to reduce duplication:
  - `make_msg` (message factory) and `fake_client_class` (tiny client base for deterministic fakes).
- Added boundary tests: exactly-at-limit has_more for messages/topics, TimeRange(start/end) ‚Üí `after:`/`before:` narrow filters.
- Added JSON schema ‚Äúcontract tests‚Äù for transformation-layer outputs: `advanced_search`, `analytics`, and `get_daily_summary` shapes.
- Kept the suite fast and offline (‚âà5‚Äì6s, no network); integration tests remain opt-in.

### üìÑ Documentation
- New testing guide at `docs/testing/README.md` (scope, fixtures/fakes, contract tests, coverage gate, cleaning, performance tips).
- Note in `AGENTS.md` about contract-only runs and the coverage gate.
- v2.5.0 documentation set retained under `docs/v2.5.0/` (reviewed alongside the testing work). Documentation efforts were coordinated with the Claude agent; this release bundles the testing and docs improvements.

### Result
- Full run: 253 passed, 3 skipped; total coverage 90.08% (gate met).
- Commands: `UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv_cache uv sync --reinstall && UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv_cache uv run pytest -q`.
