  - `rename_stream` API signature corrected for Zulip API compliance
  - `request_user_input` fully implemented with complete Zulip messaging
  - All 19 MCP tools now working flawlessly

  - Identified standard pattern: `uvx package` ‚Üí `claude mcp add` ‚Üí client-managed credentials
  - Documented findings showing 100% of successful MCP servers use simple installation
  - Created comprehensive next-session plan for standardization

### Changed - Architecture Optimization
- **Performance Enhancements Maintained**
  - Preserved 59ms average latency optimization from v2.1.0
  - Kept direct API streaming and efficient data flow patterns
  - Maintained sophisticated bot identity competitive advantage

### Removed - Legacy Non-Standard Components
- **Scripts Directory** (7 files, 1,574 lines removed)
  - `setup_claude_code.sh` - Used deprecated .env file approach
  - `test_integration.sh` - Legacy integration testing patterns
  - `test_mcp_tools.py` - Obsolete HTTP-based MCP testing
- **Documentation Files**
  - `docs/api-keys.md` - Incompatible with standard MCP credential management
  - `docs/BOT_SETUP.md` - Obsoleted by client-managed credentials
  - `.env.example` - Standard MCP doesn't use .env files
- **Planning Files**
  - `INTEGRATE-PLAN.md` - Task completed, superseded by NEXT-SESSION-PROMPT.md

### Fixed - Critical Bug Resolution
- **Type Handling in register_agent**
  ```python
  # Before: Assumed object attributes
  stream_exists = any(s.name == "Agents-Channel" for s in streams)
  
  # After: Proper dict handling  
  streams = response.get("streams", []) if response.get("result") == "success" else []
  stream_exists = any(s.get("name") == "Agents-Channel" for s in streams)
  ```

- **Zulip API Compliance in rename_stream**
  ```python
  # Before: Positional arguments causing API errors
  result = client.client.update_stream(stream_id, new_name)
  
  # After: Proper dictionary parameter
  request = {"stream_id": stream_id, "new_name": new_name}
  result = client.client.update_stream(request)
  ```

- **Complete Implementation of request_user_input**
  - Added missing Zulip message sending functionality
  - Proper user interaction with formatted requests
  - Database storage with actual messaging integration

### Research Findings - MCP Standardization
- **Current Gap**: ZulipChat MCP uses non-standard .env file configuration
- **Industry Standard**: All successful MCP servers use `uvx package` installation
- **Target UX**: `uvx zulipchat-mcp` ‚Üí `claude mcp add zulipchat` ‚Üí client prompts for credentials
- **Deviation Cost**: Complex setup vs one-line installation of competitors

### Next Session Priority

  - Enhanced `edit_message` with propagate_mode and notification parameters
  - Fixed stream management tools to use correct Zulip API endpoints

### Fixed - Tool Functionality
- **Message Tools**
  - Fixed `get_messages` tool that was expecting dict but receiving Pydantic models
